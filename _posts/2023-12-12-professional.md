I am presently engaged with the ECI program at City College, actively contributing my skills and dedication. Additionally, I've enriched my experience through participation in various Saturday STEM and Summer STEM programs at the esteemed Cooper Union. My commitment to learning is evident in my accumulation of nearly 60 credits from the ECI Program, reflecting both my passion for education and dedication to professional growth.
